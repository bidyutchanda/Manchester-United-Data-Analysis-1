# Manchester United Data Analysis #1 : How did the new managers fare at their new jobs? 


This data visualization project gives a detailed insight on how David Moyes, Louis Van Gaal and Jose Mourinho performed at the club when they became managers in their respective seasons taking into account the number of wins and losses during each season of their stay. 


**Note:** This project is in progress with more analysis on the same dataset coming up, including *Comparison for Attack and Defense across seasons* and how the team *compares with the other top-tier teams of the Premier League*. Links to those will be provided once they are ready for display. Comments and critical feedbacks are welcome.
